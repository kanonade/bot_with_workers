dbot    | Sent a cat to queue
worker  | Received a cat
worker  | Waiting random time to simulate work
worker  | Sent response for a cat

```

Also go to http://localhost:15672 and log in with guest/guest. You'll be able to see both queues, and also watch them fill/empty on a slight delay from real time.

### Scaling

To scale the workers, adjust the `worker.deploy.replicas` number in the `docker-compose.yml`.


### Warning

This repo is a proof-of-concept. It is not production-grade and lacks many things:

- Most notably nothing consumes the images queue to send generated results back to discord
- It doesn't generate images, it has a placeholder for that logic
- Rabbitmq should be used in a high availability mode
- Quorum queues should be used instead of classic queues
- There is no authentication in front of the queues
- There is no database to store generated results
- Don't hardcode the queue names, use of an exclusive queue + reply_to for the return queue
- Docker-compose is not a production deployment tool
- Perhaps use a different MQ library, like celery
